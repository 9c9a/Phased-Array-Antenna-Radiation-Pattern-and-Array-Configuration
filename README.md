# Phased Array Antenna Radiation Pattern & Array Configuration
Phased Array Antenna, Radiation Pattern and Array Configuration Phased array consisting of N lined up individual isotropic antennas with the composite main antenna beam into vertical direction. This code based on the governing equation (J. RÃ¶ttger, The Instrumental Principles of MST Radars, Ch.2.1) and shows how the radiation pattern changes as the parameters are modified.
